	abstract = {Nucleotide excision repair is a versatile mechanism to repair a variety of bulky DNA adducts. We developed excision repair sequencing (XR-seq) to study nucleotide excision repair of DNA adducts in humans, mice, Arabidopsis thaliana, yeast and Escherichia coli. In this protocol, the excised oligomers, generated in the nucleotide excision repair reaction, are isolated by cell lysis and fractionation, followed by immunoprecipitation with damage- or repair factor–specific antibodies from the non-chromatin fraction. The single-stranded excised oligomers are ligated to adapters and re-immunoprecipitated with damage-specific antibodies. The DNA damage in the excised oligomers is then reversed by enzymatic or chemical reactions before being converted into a sequencing library by PCR amplification. Alternatively, the excised oligomers containing DNA damage, especially those containing irreversible DNA damage such as benzo[a]pyrene-induced DNA adducts, can be converted to a double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) form by using appropriate translesion DNA synthesis (TLS) polymerases and then can be amplified by PCR. The current genome-wide approaches for studying repair measure the loss of damage signal with time, which limits their resolution. By contrast, an advantage of XR-seq is that the repair signal is directly detected above a background of zero. An XR-seq library using the protocol described here can be obtained in 7–9 d.},

Over a time course, we measured repair of the UV-induced damage of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) (at 1, 4, 8, 16, 24, and 48 h) and (6-4)pyrimidine-pyrimidone photoproducts [(6-4)PPs] (at 5 and 20 min and 1, 2, and 4 h) in normal human skin fibroblasts. Each type of damage has distinct repair kinetics. The (6-4)PPs are detected as early as 5 min after UV treatment, with the bulk of repair completed by 4 h. Repair of CPDs, which we previously showed is intimately coupled to transcription, is slower and in certain regions persists even 2 d after UV irradiation. We compared our results to the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements data regarding histone modifications, chromatin state, and transcription. For both damage types, and for both transcription-coupled and general excision repair, the earliest repair occurred preferentially in active and open chromatin states. Conversely, repair in regions classified as “heterochromatic” and “repressed” was relatively low at early time points, with repair persisting into the late time points. Damage that remains during DNA replication increases the risk for mutagenesis. Indeed, late-repaired regions are associated with a higher level of cancer-linked mutations. In summary, we show that XR-seq is a powerful approach for studying relationships among chromatin state, DNA repair, genome stability, mutagenesis, and carcinogenesis.},

	abstract = {Cisplatin is a major anticancer drug that kills cancer cells by damaging their DNA. Cancer cells cope with the drug by removal of the damages with nucleotide excision repair. We have developed methods to measure cisplatin adduct formation and its repair at single-nucleotide resolution. “Damage-seq” relies on the replication-blocking properties of the bulky base lesions to precisely map their location. “XR-seq” independently maps the removal of these damages by capturing and sequencing the excised oligomer released during repair. The damage and repair maps we generated reveal that damage distribution is essentially uniform and is dictated mostly by the underlying sequence. In contrast, cisplatin repair is heterogeneous in the genome and is affected by multiple factors including transcription and chromatin states. Thus, the overall effect of damages in the genome is primarily driven not by damage formation but by the repair efficiency. The combination of the Damage-seq and XR-seq methods has the potential for developing novel cancer therapeutic strategies.},

	abstract = {Platinum-based chemotherapies, including oxaliplatin, are a mainstay in the management of solid tumors and induce cell death by forming intrastrand dinucleotide DNA adducts. Despite their common use, they are highly toxic, and approximately half of cancer patients have tumors that are either intrinsically resistant or develop resistance. Previous studies suggest that this resistance is mediated by variations in DNA repair levels or net drug influx. Here, we aimed to better define the roles of nucleotide excision repair and DNA damage in platinum chemotherapy resistance by profiling DNA damage and repair efficiency in seven oxaliplatin-sensitive and three oxaliplatin-resistant colorectal cancer cell lines. We assayed DNA repair indirectly as toxicity and directly measured bulky adduct formation and removal from the genome by slot blot and repair capacity in an excision assay, and used excision repair sequencing (XR-seq) to map repair events genome-wide at single-nucleotide resolution. Using this combinatorial approach and proxies for oxaliplatin–DNA damage, we observed no significant differences in repair efficiency that could explain the relative sensitivities and chemotherapy resistances of these cell lines. In contrast, the levels of oxaliplatin-induced DNA damage were significantly lower in the resistant cells, indicating that decreased damage formation, rather than increased damage repair, is a major determinant of oxaliplatin resistance in these cell lines. XR-seq–based analysis of gene expression revealed up-regulation of membrane transport pathways in the resistant cells, and these pathways may contribute to resistance. In conclusion, additional research is needed to characterize the factors mitigating cellular DNA damage formation by platinum compounds.},

The newly identified elements also show a statistical correspondence to sequence variants linked to human disease, and can thereby guide interpretation of this variation. Overall, the project provides new insights into the organization and regulation of our genes and genome, and is an expansive resource of functional annotations for biomedical research.},

Human nucleotide excision repair generates two incisions surrounding the site of damage, creating an ∼30-mer. In XR-seq, this fragment is isolated and subjected to high-throughput sequencing. We used XR-seq to produce stranded, nucleotide-resolution maps of repair of two UV-induced DNA damages in human cells: cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) and (6-4) pyrimidine–pyrimidone photoproducts [(6-4)PPs]. In wild-type cells, CPD repair was highly associated with transcription, specifically with the template strand. Experiments in cells defective in either transcription-coupled excision repair or general excision repair isolated the contribution of each pathway to the overall repair pattern and showed that transcription-coupled repair of both photoproducts occurs exclusively on the template strand. XR-seq maps capture transcription-coupled repair at sites of divergent gene promoters and bidirectional enhancer RNA (eRNA) production at enhancers. XR-seq data also uncovered the repair characteristics and novel sequence preferences of CPDs and (6-4)PPs. XR-seq and the resulting repair maps will facilitate studies of the effects of genomic location, chromatin context, transcription, and replication on DNA repair in human cells.},
